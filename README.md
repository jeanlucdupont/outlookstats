## Email is Evil (like Excel).
- Email is a productivity killer.
- Reading email is usually not productive.
- Reading emails where you are in CC is rarely productive.
- Reading emails where you are in a distribution group is very rarely productive.
- Oh, but wait, the emails that I write are productive, right?

 
Every year, I review my Outlook statistics and see where I wasted my time. Iâ€™d expect Outlook to provide this information natively, but I do it manually. Until now. 

## Introducing OutlookStats.

Sample report [here](https://securityrabbits.com/outlookstats.html)! 

OutlookStats will answer the following questions, over the last year:
- How many emails did I read and not read?
- What is the longest thread (that could have been managed by a simple phone call)?
- Who are the top senders?
- Who are the top senders who put me in CC?
- Who are the top senders who put me in a distribution list?
- Who are my top recipients?
- How many days did I spend in meetings?
- How many days did I spend in meetings I have organized?
- Who are the top people creating meetings?
- How many meetings did I decline?
- How many meetings were conflicting with other meetings?

Get the right information to:
- Clean up your Outlook.
- Change your habbits.
- Be more productive.
